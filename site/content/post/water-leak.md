We currently have a water leak on Oliver Street. We are not sure at this time how long customers will be without water. We will update as soon as the leak is fixed and service is restored.

The following streets are under a boil water advisory until further notice:

Oliver Street (west of 31), Courtyard Drive, Cottonwood Drive, Bent Tree Lane and Lone Oak Drive.
