H﻿appy Friday,

O﻿ur team is excited to annouce that we are in the beginnings of developing a bike/pedestrian master plan for the City of Scottsville! This master plan will focus on the creation of projects that will enhance bicycle and pedestrian facilities in our community- think sidewalks and bike lanes. We want as many community members to be involved in this process and encourage you all to fill out our survey here: <!--StartFragment-->
