If you’re unable to attend, you can listen to the meeting on WLCK-1250 AM or 100.1 FM. 

We plan on broadcasting Live on City of Scottsville Facebook page, but we have two technicians out and we were unable to broadcast our last meeting. We hope to have available personnel for Monday’s meeting, so we can carry it Live. 

We apologize for any inconvenience.
