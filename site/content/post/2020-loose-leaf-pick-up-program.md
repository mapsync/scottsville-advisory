### **\--- Citizen Guidelines ---**

1. The city is divided into four (4) work zones. Leaf pickup operations will not begin in a zone before its scheduled pickup dates.
2. Leaves should be raked to the edge of the street BEFORE the first scheduled pickup day.
3. Crews will pick up leaves from the edge of a city street which the residence faces. If a residence is on a corner of two streets, each street may not be in the same work zone. Crews do not go onto private property such as along driveways or behind houses to pick up leaves.
4. Leaves may be bagged at any time and scheduled for pickup by calling City Hall at (270) 237-3238.
5. Leaves must not be placed on sidewalks, in the street or gutter lines, around fire hydrants, mailboxes, guy wires or parked vehicles and must not obstruct drainage structures.
6. Leaf piles must be free of any debris including tree limbs, rocks, household trash, discarded furniture, wheels/tires or any other debris that may cause damage to equipment or injury to crews.
7. If you miss your scheduled leaf pickup day, call City Hall at (270) 237-3238 to be placed on the wait list. As time permits, we will take this list and backtrack to pick up your leaves.
8. When parked vehicles interfere with leaf pickup operations, we will be forced to leave any inaccessible leaves in place.
9. Should there be a measurable snowfall event during the leaf pickup schedule that would warrant snow removal from city streets, leaf pickup operations will be postponed. Once the weather permits and the streets are clear of snow, crews will resume leaf pickup operations in the zone scheduled per the advertised leaf
   pickup schedule. Zones that were skipped for the snow event will be picked up as time permits.
