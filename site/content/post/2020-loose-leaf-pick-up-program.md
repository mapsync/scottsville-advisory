1. The city is divided into four (4) work zones. Leaf Pickup operations will not begin in a zone before it's scheduled pickup dates.
2. Leaves should be raked to the edge of the street BEFORE the first pick up day.
3. Crews will pick up leaves from the edge of a city street which the residence faces. If a residence is on a corner of two streets, each street may not be in the same work zone. Crews do not go onto private property such as along driveways or behind houses to pick up leaves.
