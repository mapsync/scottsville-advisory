description: >-
  Flushing rids the water of mineral sediment, facilitates regular maintenance
  and ensures the hydrants are in a high state of serviceability in the event of
  an emergency. During flushing the hydrants are tested as well. Periodic
  testing of fire hydrants is required to maintain them.

  If water is discolored, it can usually be remedied by running a cold water tap for 4-5 minutes or until the water clears.  Postponing laundry until the water is clear (usually no more than one day) is recommended.

P﻿eriodically, you will see the City of Scottsville personnel releasing water from hydrants.  Hydrant flushing is necessary to test the hydrants to make sure adequate flow and pressure is available. Flushing is also done to remove sediment from the pipes to maintain water clarity and quality in the distribution pipes.

Y﻿es, your water is safe to drink. Occasionally, water becomes discolored after hydrant flushing, if this happens, run your cold water tap for a few minutes until the water clears.  If it doesn't clear the first time, wait a few minutes and run the water again.  You should avoid washing clothes until the water clears.

B﻿eginning Wednesday, August 14, 2024, the City of Scottsville will start the flushing process.
