title: Old Gallatin Road Thursday Trash Customers Pick-Up Day to Change
  Effective Week of June 6, 2022
draft: false
date: 2022-05-25T20:51:49.462Z
description: Beginning the week of June 6, 2022, those customers on Old Gallatin
  Road with Thursday trash pick up, will have their pick up day changed to
  Wednesday. Trash will be picked up after Noon on Wednesday.
---
The addresses affected will be from 822 Old Gallatin Road to 2294 Old Gallatin Road for Thursday customers.  Door hangars were distributed and letters mailed to all affected customers concerning the new pick up day.

The reasons for the change in the pick up day are (a) traffic safety concerns in the morning on Old Gallatin Road (b) reduce the number of Thursday stops, the heaviest day, and provide more balance for the Wednesday route, which is the lightest day of stops.

If you have any questions, please call the Mayor's Office at 270.237.3238.
