This service is free and available to all residents that have done their own cleanup. 

If you hire a contractor to cut trees and do cleanup, it’s the responsibility of the contractor to dispose of the debris, not the City of Scottsville. 

When you get the debris to the curb, call the Mayor’s office at 270.237.3238 to schedule a pick up.
