From the Scottsville-Allen County Chamber of Commerce Facebook page:

Attention!!!

After speaking with the Health Department this morning it has been brought to my attention that the Chamber will have to cancel the parade for 2020. All of the surrounding counties have cancelled due to being in the red zone. I am so sorry to have to post this announcement but let's all look forward to 2021 in hopes for a better and bigger year. If you have any questions, please call the Chamber office @ 270-237-4782. Thank you!
