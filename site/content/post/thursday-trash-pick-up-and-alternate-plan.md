description: Decision by 6 AM Thursday morning

We will make a decision by 6 AM Thursday morning about Thursday's trash pick up.  Based on the weather forecast of freezing rain and ice in the morning, it's unlikely that Thursday's trash route will be run. If we're unable to pick up Thursday trash, it will be picked up on Friday, along with regular Friday customers.
